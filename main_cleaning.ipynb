    "### Main data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The data cleaning pipeline has four stages:\n",
    "1. remove outliers using a) interquartile ratio with cutoff of 2.5 and b) \"natural\" bounds from other research or experimental design\n",
    "2. standardize continuous variables using StandardScaler\n",
    "3. calculate interaction terms between anxiety and depression\n",
    "4. stratify bad life events (top/bottom 15%) and (maybe) calculate interactions between bad and good life events\n",
    "5. propogate fixed demographic variables captured at baseline across subsequent timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variables for each step are specified in `data_cleaning.py` and interaction functions are defined in `interactions.py`. It is straightforward to edit either of these files to add/remove variables and interactions."
